Description: Contains functions useful for reading in Licor 6800 files,
    correcting and analyzing rapid A/Ci response (RACiR) data. Requires some
    user interaction to adjust the calibration (empty chamber) data file to 
    a useable range. Calibration uses a 1st to 5th order polynomial as 
    suggested in Stinziano et al. (2017) <doi:10.1111/pce.12911>.
    Data can be processed individually or batch processed for all files paired
    with a given calibration file. RACiR is a trademark of LI-COR Biosciences,
